' VBA Sync Module
'
' Bidirectional sync between Excel VBA projects and filesystem for version control,
' collaboration, and AI assistance.
'
' EXPORT: Extracts all VBA code (modules, classes, forms, sheets) and Excel structure
'         (tables, worksheets, workbook metadata) to organized folder structure.
'         Creates Git configuration files (.gitattributes, .gitignore, README.md).
'         Enables professional development workflows with version control, code review,
'         IDE editing, team collaboration, and AI assistance.
'
' IMPORT: Reads VBA code files from filesystem back into Excel VBA project.
'         Updates existing components or creates new ones as needed.
'         Preserves Excel structure (import is VBA code only).
'
' INSTALLATION:
' 1. Download VBA Sync.xlam add-in file
' 2. Copy to Excel add-ins folder (typically %APPDATA%\Microsoft\AddIns\)
'    Alternative: Double-click .xlam file and Excel will prompt to install
' 3. Open Excel > File > Options > Add-ins > Excel Add-ins > Browse
' 4. Select VBA Sync.xlam and check the box to enable it
' 5. Click OK - the VBA Sync tab should appear in the ribbon
' 6. If tab doesn't appear: restart Excel or check macro security settings
'
' REQUIREMENTS:
' - Workbook must be saved locally or on synced drive (not SharePoint URLs)
' - Enable "Trust access to the VBA project object model":
'   1. File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings
'   2. Macro Settings > Check "Trust access to the VBA project object model"
'   3. Click OK and restart Excel
' - RECOMMENDED: Save/backup your workbook before first export
'
' USAGE:
' Access via VBA Sync ribbon tab with Export and Import buttons.
' (Note: Ribbon tab appears when a workbook is open, works with .xlsx/.xlsm/.xls files)
'
' WORKFLOW:
' 1. Export: Click "Export" button - creates clean file structure for version control
' 2. Develop: Edit code in VS Code, use Git, get AI help
' 3. Import: Click "Import" button - loads changes back into Excel VBA project
'
' FOLDER STRUCTURE:
' Creates folder structure named after workbook:
'   MyWorkbook\
'     Objects\      - Sheet and ThisWorkbook modules
'     Modules\      - Standard modules
'     ClassModules\ - Class modules
'     Forms\        - UserForms
'     Excel\        - Workbook structure files
'
' ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
' - Creates .gitattributes, .gitignore, and README.md if they don't exist
' - Empty document modules (Sheets/ThisWorkbook) are skipped during export
' - Stale files are automatically cleaned up to keep folders tidy
